                                  anchored frame also takes the run's anchor

                                  LABEL exists), e.g. one camera view

DIR is a run's frame directory, holding the dumper's frame_NNNN.bmp files
(d3d11_dump: dump k is present 60k+1) or flip_NNNNN.bmp files
(fb_dump_at, named by flip; flip N is present N). Dump k is looked up
as frame_000k.bmp, else as flip 60k+1.

Skips. A scenario's (or frame's) "skip_backends" list, e.g. ["cpu"], with
"skip_why", leaves its frames unchecked on a run whose flip log shows that
backend (D3D11 or METAL flip lines, else cpu): SKIP, which neither passes
nor fails. For a scenario whose timeline a slow backend cannot follow.

Masks. A frame's "masks" list ({"rect": [x, y, w, h], "why": ...}) takes
those pixels out of the compare: the run's pixels there are replaced by
the reference's, and a split frame leaves them out of its panel, overlay
and background. For a part of the screen that animates on a clock the
anchor does not follow (a pulsing button, a blinking prompt); keep each
rect to the pixels that differ. A mask may carry "presence": {"pixel_tol",
"max_bad_fraction", "max_channel_mae"}: its pixels may animate but must
stay that close to the reference (the thing is still there).

Event anchors. A frame may name an anchor, "anchor": {"event": E,
"ref_flip": R}, where the scenario's "anchors" define E as the first flip at
or after `after_flip` where the run's flip log (RECOMP_TRACE=flip lines
"[D3D11] flip N batches B" or "[METAL] flip N batches B") crosses into at
least `min_batches` (or at most `max_batches`) batches: this flip and the
next qualify, the one before does not. R is that flip in the reference run (a reference in
`references` may carry its own "anchor_flip"). With the run's log (--log, or
DIR/../game-stdio.log, or DIR.log) giving the run's anchor A, the frame is
checked at flip A + (60*dump + 1 - R): the same distance from the event as
the reference, so a run whose timeline starts a few presents early or late
is compared with the frame it means. That needs flip_NNNNN.bmp dumps; a run
with no flip dumps, no anchor in its log, or not the target flip is
INCOMPLETE (exit 2) for that frame, never compared at the plain dump. --window K (default 2) also
compares the flips within K of the target and prints the best one: a
diagnostic, the verdict is the target's.

Pace. Some content follows wall time, not flips (the title's cloud movie),
so a run flipping at another rate lands elsewhere in it. The run's pace
(flips per wall second from its anchor to the target, from the "[GPU] flip
N T ms" lines) is compared with the reference run's over the same span (the
anchor's "ref_pace", or a reference's "pace"; written by record/reference).
Off by more than max_pace_diff (frame, scenario or compare; default 0.10),
an EXACT or in-limits frame still passes (CLOSE notes the mismatch); one
outside its limits is INCOMPLETE "pace mismatch (run X fps vs ref Y fps)",
not FAIL, unless every reference is off by pace_fail_bad (default 0.5) of
its pixels or more: a wrong screen at any pace, FAIL. No recorded pace, a
target not after the anchor, or max_pace_diff null is no check. The limit
is a ratio, but the harm is drift (span x ratio): a long span drifts
further at the same ratio, so set a frame's max_pace_diff to its span.

The verdict: exit 1 on any FAIL, else 2 on any INCOMPLETE (counts printed).
golden.json names, per scenario, the frames to check (by dump index) and the
thresholds; it holds hashes and metrics only. The reference PNGs live in
analysis/golden/frames/, which is gitignored: they are game frames.

The hash is SHA-256 of the RGB pixels (rows top-down, 3 bytes a pixel, alpha
dropped), so it does not depend on the file format. A frame passes when its
hash equals the reference's, or else when every channel's mean absolute
difference from the reference PNG is at most `max_channel_mae` (0..255) and
the share of pixels differing by more than `pixel_tol` in any channel is at
most `max_bad_fraction`, and in no 64x64 tile is that share above
`max_tile_bad_fraction`; each frame may override any of the limits, and
its `regions` may set their own tile limit (see tile_violation()). A frame with a reference hash and no reference PNG
can only pass by hash.

A frame whose content legitimately comes in a few fixed forms (the hub's
camera opens on one of several views at random) lists them as
`references`: [{"label", "sha256", "size"}, ...], with the PNGs at
frames/<name>.<label>.png, instead of one sha256. It passes when it matches
any one of them by hash or within the frame's limits, the same limits for
each, so every reference is checked as strictly as a single one.

A frame with `split` (the hub: a fixed 2D panel over a random 3D view) is
judged in parts instead: the panel's opaque overlay strictly in any view,
the panel rects strictly and the background loosely against the view the
background matches. A view not seen before is NEWVIEW, which is
INCOMPLETE: someone looks at it and records it. See "split frames" below.

`dumpat` and `check` print a WARNING (stderr; never a failure) when a game
process of the game's exe is running (running_game.py): an installed copy left open
beside a Metal or CPU golden run makes its timings noisy.

# ---- split frames: a fixed overlay over a 3D view that varies ---------------
#
# A frame with "split" is judged in parts instead of as a whole. Its panel is
# the 2D overlay (text, a counter, a prompt) at fixed rects; the rest is the
# 3D background. golden.json:
#
#   "split": {
#     "panel":      {"rects": [[x, y, w, h], ...], <limits>},
#     "overlay":    {"max_spread": S, "min_luma": L, "min_pixels": N,
#                    "max_bad_fraction": F},
#     "background": {<limits>, "new_view_min_mae": M, "min_luma_std": D}
#   }
#
# <limits> are max_channel_mae, max_bad_fraction and max_tile_bad_fraction,
# over the selected pixels only (a tile's share is of its selected pixels;
# tiles with under TILE*TILE/8 of them are not judged on their own).
#
# 1. Overlay (view-independent, strict). The pixels in the panel rects where
#    every reference agrees within S in each channel and is at least L luma
#    are the opaque overlay: the same in every view. Fewer than N such pixels
#    is a setup error. The frame must match them (within the frame's
#    pixel_tol of the references' range) with at most F bad, whatever the
#    view; otherwise FAIL.
# 2. Known view. A reference whose background matches within the
#    background's (loose) limits names the view; the panel rects must then
#    match that reference within the panel's (strict) limits: CLOSE, else
#    FAIL.
# 3. Unknown view. No background matches. If the panel rects match a view
#    (their translucent parts show the scene, so other views do not), or the
#    closest background is within mae M of it (new_view_min_mae; different
#    views are far apart), it is that view rendered differently: FAIL. A flat
#    background (luma standard deviation under D, min_luma_std): FAIL.
#    Otherwise NEWVIEW, which is INCOMPLETE, not a pass: the overlay holds
#    the opaque text, but the scene is unchecked and a broken render can
#    look like a new view. Look at it; if it is right, record it (golden.py
#    reference) so it is held from then on.
