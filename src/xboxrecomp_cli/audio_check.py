"""Checks on an audio dump (RECOMP_DEBUG=audio_wav) or an xemu reference capture.

  audio_check.py WAV [--log LOG] [--rate] [--golden JSON --scenario NAME]
                     [--voice-dump RAW ...] [--dump-rate HZ]
                     [--ref REF.wav] [--json]

Needs numpy (nothing else outside the standard library). A system python3
has none; the game's tools environment (<game> setup's .venv) does, and
`<game> audio-check` runs it there.

Report, always:
  duration, rate and channels; first sound (first sample at or above the
  silence floor, -40 dBFS by default); RMS per 100 ms window (min / median /
  max after the first sound, all of them with --json); dropouts (runs of
  digital zero, every channel, longer than the limit -- 2 ms -- between the
  first and the last sound, with sound at or above the silence floor in the
  50 ms on each side: trailing silence is not a dropout, and neither are the
  zeros a blank movie track dithers through); clipping (the share of samples
  at full scale).

With --log: the sample-rate ratio, from the toolkit's two submit lines
    [APU] first submit t=<seconds>
    [APU] last submit t=<seconds> [samples=<frames submitted in between>]
  ratio = frames / (rate x (t_last - t_first)), frames being samples= when
  present, else the WAV's frame count (a WAV capped by audio_wav_secs
  needs samples=). --rate makes a missing pair of lines a failure.

With --log, also host starvation: the toolkit's lines (RECOMP_TRACE=apu or
    RECOMP_TRACE=audio_host)
    [AUDIO-HOST] starve wav=<sample index> ms=<length> ...
  each a stretch the host device had nothing queued and played silence. The
  WAV tap records submissions back to back, so it has no hole there; the
  check splices that much digital zero in at that index first, so the
  dropout check below runs on what the speaker played, not on what the
  guest mixed. Reported as host starvation (count, total ms).

With --log, also stale-lap replays (RECOMP_TRACE=apu_ring): a title that
  streams compressed audio decodes it into a looping buffer voice and keeps
  writing ahead of the play cursor; when the writer falls behind, the voice
  plays the previous lap again. That is no digital zero, and under the rest
  of the mix the checks above cannot see it, but it is audible as a stutter
  or a voice cutting out. The toolkit's once-a-second lines
    [APU-RING] t=<s> v=<voice> ... stale_total=<n> ...
  count, per voice, 1 KB blocks played again unchanged since their last
  play; the check fails when the total over all voices exceeds
  max_ring_stale (0). Not with --golden, unless the JSON sets it: the
  golden gate leaves it out until a clean run shows that a stream's last
  lap, played again as the stream ends, does not trip it.

With --voice-dump RAW (repeatable; RECOMP_DEBUG=apu_voice_dump=all writes
  one s16 stereo file per voice): the same thing offline. Every 256-frame
  chunk (at a 64-frame step, digital silence skipped) is looked up among the
  chunks before it, up to 2^20 frames back; an exact match is a replay.
  Consecutive matches at one lag make a run. A slot that plays the same
  one-shot sound again repeats all of it (a run about as long as the lag);
  a starved ring repeats in bursts, so only runs shorter than half their lag
  count, and replayed audio over max_replay_ms (0) fails. A writer that
  misses a whole lap escapes this; the [APU-RING] check sees it.

With --ref: the envelope cross-correlation lag (1 ms envelope, searched within
  +/- max_lag_ms, 500 ms) and its peak correlation, then per-band spectral
  correlation of the aligned signals: 8 log-spaced bands from 50 Hz to 16 kHz,
  each band's energy over 1 s windows (in 1/48 s frames) correlated between the
  two and averaged over the windows. Bands silent in both are skipped.

Noise (when max_noise_fraction is below 1, which the golden JSON sets): the
  spectral flatness of each 1 s window of the mono mix at or above the silence
  floor -- geometric over arithmetic mean of the Hann-windowed power spectrum
  between 200 Hz and 16 kHz, and the share of the window's energy above 8 kHz.
  Music sits well under 0.3 flatness with a few percent up there; white noise
  gives about 0.56 (a single periodogram's chi-square bins, not 1.0) and two
  thirds. A window at or above both noise_flatness and noise_hf_share is
  noise-like, and the check fails when more than max_noise_fraction of the
  windows are. This is what caught the APU reading .text as PCM (every effect
  full-scale static, the music's upper half gone): that dump passed every
  other check.

  The limits sit between what was measured: clean runs (five, 60-105 s, title
  and in-game) peak at flatness 0.315 and 16 % above 8 kHz; the .text-as-PCM
  windows were 0.40-0.51 and 57-67 %. noise_flatness 0.36 leaves 0.045 of
  margin on each side and noise_hf_share 0.25 leaves 0.09 below and 0.3
  above. A scenario with sustained broadband effects (wind, water, crowd)
  can sit higher on both and still be clean: give that scenario its own
  noise_flatness / noise_hf_share / max_noise_fraction in the golden JSON
  (its keys override `compare`), measured from a run known good by ear,
  rather than raising the shared limits.

With --golden JSON --scenario NAME: thresholds from the JSON's `compare`,
  overridden by the scenario's own keys (any of the limits below), and the
  scenario's `first_sound_window` [lo, hi] seconds. Without --golden the
  built-in defaults below apply and first sound is only required to exist.

Exit 0 when every check passes, 1 on a failed check (each failure printed as
FAIL with the scenario and the window or value), 2 on a usage error or an
unreadable file.
